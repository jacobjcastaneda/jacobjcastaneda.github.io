title: 'Qualification Exams: Study Goals'
---

# Purpose:

  As a new PhD student I have been tasked with studying for my Qualification Exams in the Civil & Environmental Engineering program at Stanford University. While brainstorming how to best achieve this aim, I realized that a fun and trackable way of doing this was to create blog posts. As a result, I am going to attempt to create informative, thorough, and intuitive posts about fluid mechanics as I prepare for my Quals.

# Method:

  In order to truly test the state of my knowledge I am going to take an iterative approach. Each blog post will, more or less, focus on a narrow scope. I will draft, without extra resources, a description of the topic that I intend to discuss. I will revisit my work periodically in order to update, fix, and improve my posts. This, in my opinion, will help me in the study process.

# Goal:

  At the end of this process I hope that I have created, or at least have the basis for creating, a platform which helps emerging fluid dynamicists. Thus, I hope that any and all readers find this work helpful.

# Please Help:

  If you happen to be an experienced fluid dynamicist and find issue with any material at all, please contact me so that I may remedy the issue.
