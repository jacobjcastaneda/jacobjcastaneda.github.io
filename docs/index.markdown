I am a PhD candidate in the Civil & Environmental Engineering department at Stanford University. My advisor is <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~fringer/">Oliver Fringer</a> of the <a href="https://cee.stanford.edu/research-impact/labs-centers/bob-and-norma-street-environmental-fluid-mechanics-laboratory-efml">Bob and Norma Street Environmental Fluid Mechanics Lab (EFML)</a>.

My research focuses on elucidating the physics of sediment transport and identifying sediment pathways in San Francisco Bay. This pursuit is critical  as we pursue sustainability in the midst of sea level rise, climate change, and continued anthropogenic impacts. I am passionate about all things pertaining to fluid mechanics and computer science. My aim is to someday develop engineering software that makes a difference for practicing engineers.

In my free time, you can find me cross training, trying to quantitatively track my health, or most likely spending time with my favorite ladies --  my wife, Katie, and mini Goldendoodle, Stella!
